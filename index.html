          <article>Elitists have spotted a big oopsie in cunny-themed spaces: a trust-based verification system. 😱 It's all about sharing loli folders for access, but hey, it's easy for sneaky peeps to slip through. So, we switched gears to a super-secret encryption method, using Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman P-521 for key exchanges. Shh, it's our little secret! Discord can't crack this code, keeping our space safe and sound. 🤫 But if you want extra safety, maybe check out federated homeservers on Matrix, just saying! (¬‿¬)</article>

  <header>メンヘラ (Menhera) ✧(>o<)ﾉ✧</header>
  <div id="wrapper-content">
    <article>
      Menhera, Japanese net slang, refers to peeps who might be battling mental health issues. Originally a buzzword on 2Channel's Menherer (now Menhera) board, it started as "Menhel" from "mental health". (･ω<)☆ It's a broad term, not pinned to any specific illness but full of nuanced meanings.

      While Menhera aimed to dodge discrimination, it's still wrapped in stigma. These individuals can be unpredictable, showing behaviors like stalking, epic tantrums, craving attention, loyalty tests, and even self-harm threats. (⊙_☉)

      By the late 2010s, Menhera morphed into a fashion statement through 'Yami Kawaii' substyle, boldly challenging Japan's view on mental health. Think pastel med accessories, syringes, pins with nooses + pills, and vent art on oversized clothes! Super kawaii yet deep. (✿◠‿◠)

      "Wrist cut warrior Menherachan/メンヘラチャン" by Bisuko Ezaki, began as vent art and became a Yami Kawaii icon! But, plot twist! In 2019, Ezaki trademarked 'Menhera,' causing a stir. Now, it's often seen by Western Instagrammers as just a 'sickly cute aesthetic.' （╹◡╹）

      Dating a Menhera? It's like, super intense, and breaking up? That's a whole new level of drama! (⊙﹏⊙✿)

    <article>On November 21, 2023, Little Witch Nobeta faced a critical moment. The admins' failure to moderate loli-themed content led to a breach of Discord's guidelines. As kaomojians reached out to integrate LWN members into our community, many hesitated, torn between fear and indifference. A poignant chapter in our history. ｡ﾟ(ﾟ´Д｀ﾟ)ﾟ｡</article>
