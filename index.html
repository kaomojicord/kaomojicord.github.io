      <p style="font-size:8px" class="wrap">As the name suggests, the instance is inspired by the board Ê¼DQNÊ¼ - which goes by the name of â€œThe Elitist Superstructure of DQNâ€œ - featured on the textboard 4-ch.net.</p>

      <p style="font-size:8px" class="wrap">Since the instance is designed to be a safe space for rorikons, nijikons, otakus, larpers, trolls & baiters, the mood of the instance can fluctuate drastically as various archetypes are encompassed which may conflict with each other.</p>

      <p style="font-size:8px" class="wrap">In order to maintain safety & the well-being of the instance, the Ê¼elitistsÊ¼ operate the application known as â€œâ”¬â”´â”¬â”´â”¤( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ–â”œâ”¬â”´â”¬â”´â€œ which is equipped with various modules to ease tasks such as communication, filesharing, moderation, and so on. It must be noted that the creature struggles to maintain a stable uptime due to parasites known as â€œUND_ERR_CONNECT_TIMEOUTâ€œ. The creature is visually represented by the fictional character Ê¼Kurumi TokisakiÊ¼ from the light novel series Ê¼Date A LiveÊ¼, serving as a tribute to one of the Ê¼elitistsÊ¼ who deem her tasteful.

      <p style="font-size:12px">bridge</p>
      <p style="font-size:8px" class="wrap">Communication is key. Ever since the bridge module was introduced, kaomojians have adapted to the channel â€œwwwï¹’â¦‹-cÂ°â–¥Â°â¦Œ-câ€œ whose purpose is to bridge to tasteful spaces with a fairly good amount of values & politics shared in common. One such party is known as the korewans, originating from â€œKorewaDiscordâ€œ ( <a href=https://smugs-underground.fandom.com/wiki/Smug's_Underground_Wiki> initially known as â€œSmug's Undergroundâ€œ</a> ). </p>
      <p style="font-size:12px">Ê¼The Kaomojian-Korewan Civil WarÊ¼</p>
      <p style="font-size:8px" class="wrap">Throughout the early days of the established bridge between the kaomojians & the korewans, a sudden outburst by the kaomojians took place that triggered & led to a short-lived civil war between both parties, ultimately lasted about twenty minutes & resulted in an awkward capitulation of kaomojians. No injuries took place, however, the Faggot Dome has neutralized almost all kaomojian rocket missiles aimed towards #general where innocent korewan residents were almost striked.</p>
