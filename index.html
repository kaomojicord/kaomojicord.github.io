        <p class="text">In order to maintain safety & the well-being of the instance, the ʼelitistsʼ operate the application known as “┬┴┬┴┤( ͡° ͜ʖ├┬┴┬┴“ which is equipped with various modules to ease tasks such as communication, filesharing, moderation, and so on. It must be noted that the creature struggles to maintain a stable uptime due to parasites known as “UND_ERR_CONNECT_TIMEOUT“. The creature is visually represented by the fictional character ʼKurumi Tokisakiʼ from the light novel series ʼDate A Liveʼ, serving as a tribute to one of the ʼelitistsʼ who deem her tasteful.

        <p class="text">Communication is key. Ever since the bridge module was introduced, kaomojians have adapted to the channel “www﹒⦋-c°▥°⦌-c“ whose purpose is to bridge to tasteful spaces with a fairly good amount of values & politics shared in common. One such party is known as the korewans, originating from “KorewaDiscord“ ( <a href=https://smugs-underground.fandom.com/wiki/Smug's_Underground_Wiki> initially known as “Smug's Underground“</a> ). </p>

      <center>
        <p class="text">Throughout the early days of the established bridge between the kaomojians & the korewans, a sudden outburst by the kaomojians took place that triggered & led to a short-lived civil war between both parties, ultimately lasted about twenty minutes & resulted in an awkward capitulation of kaomojians. No injuries took place, however, the Faggot Dome has neutralized almost all kaomojian rocket missiles aimed towards #general where innocent korewan residents were almost striked.</p>

      <p class="title">trust-based vs encrypted lolicon servers</p>
      <center>
        <p class="text">The elitists have noticed a huge flaw that cunny-themed spaces on discord have adapted themselves to: a trust-based verification system. The way administrators intend to authorize a new member is by requesting a loli folder sample - either as a screenshot or as a zip file - in order for them to be granted access to their space. Said administrators rely on the fact that any person with ill intentions can easily get through the system by sharing a sample one can easily obtain, hoping that this person is not a reportfag, someone with pedophilic tendencies, or an actual minor. To prevent the risk of having a space suspended by the multi-billion company that discord is, one must understand the root of the problem. The elitists have begun relying on a symmetric block cipher algorithm with a block/chunk size of 256 bits in order to encrypt lolicon illustrations by using open-source code either via extension, plugin, windows shell or userscript. For functionality & authentification, keys must be exchanged between the recipients through a cryptographic key exchange algorithm. In our case, the protocol Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman P-521 is used, and the key exchange takes place in the direct messages of the recipient. Since discord does not have access to the key, they are therefore unable to decrypt said content especially since it is almost impossible to break through such tight encryption. Even if their Trust & Safety team were to obtain said key, there has not been a single case where they have used the provided key to decrypt the content. If preferred to stay on guaranteed safe land for whatever reasons you may have, it is recommended to rely on federated homeservers on matrix for such purposes instead.</p>

      <p class="title">menhera & jirai-onna</p>
      <center>
        <p class="text">Menhera is a japanese slang term referring to a person who is suffering from mental illness or is in need of mental health care. The term is derived from ʼmental health(er)ʼ and is equivalent to what we would universally refer to as ʼpsychoʼ. This archetype is not too uncommon, and you see those type of people luring around 4chan tagged disboard servers or on problematic, controversial fandoms & generally any socmed spaces featuring ʼfancy aesthetic kawaii moeʼ themes. A fairly new associated term since 2020 would be the character trope ʼlandmine-girlʼ or ʼjirai-onnaʼ - not to be confused with the japanese fashion ʼjirai-keiʼ - as the japanese would say, which refers to younger, underage vulnerable & manipulative girls who suffer from major personality issues, anxiety, emotional instability & tend to have a messy relationship history as well as seem overly attached to social media & their overall online presence, especially putting value on how they represent themselves and seek for attention. Ultimately, those very mentally draining individuals are better to be avoided especially since one could potentially get into legal troubles that's if being mentally drained isn't sufficient already.</p>
