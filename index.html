      <p style="font-size:10px">The Elitist Superstructure of (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧ ( Kaomojicord ) is a rorikon-themed social hangout server hosted on discord & run by a group of anonymous users, known as ʼelitistsʼ.</p>

      <p style="font-size:10px">As the name suggests, the instance is inspired by the board ʼDQNʼ - which goes by the name of “The Elitist Superstructure of DQN“ - featured on the textboard 4-ch.net.</p>
      <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1151138036810256534/1173253372581789737/The_Elitist_Superstructure_of_DQN.jpg?ex=6563485a&is=6550d35a&hm=1e566094453c4eee6a5458f2fa8f0cd713d034d7492b7e1f64f801676ee890db&" alt="dqn" width="200" height=auto> 
      <p style="font-size:16px">community</p>
      <p style="font-size:10px">Since the instance is designed to be a safe space for rorikons, nijikons, otakus, larpers, trolls & baiters, the mood of the instance can fluctuate drastically as various archetypes are encompassed which may conflict with each other.</p>
      <p style="font-size:16px">mechanical creature</p>
      <p style="font-size:10px">In order to maintain safety & the well-being of the instance, the ʼelitistsʼ operate the application known as “┬┴┬┴┤( ͡° ͜ʖ├┬┴┬┴“ which is equipped with various modules to ease tasks such as communication, filesharing, moderation, and so on. It must be noted that the creature struggles to maintain a stable uptime due to parasites known as “UND_ERR_CONNECT_TIMEOUT“. The creature is visually represented by the fictional character ʼKurumi Tokisakiʼ from the light novel series ʼDate A Liveʼ, serving as a tribute to one of the ʼelitistsʼ who deem her tasteful.

      <p style="font-size:16px">bridge</p>
      <p style="font-size:10px">Communication is key. Ever since the bridge module was introduced, kaomojians have adapted to the channel “www﹒⦋-c°▥°⦌-c“ which purpose is to bridge to tasteful spaces with a fairly good amount of values & politics shared in common. One such party is known as the korewans, originating from “KorewaDiscord“ ( <a href=https://smugs-underground.fandom.com/wiki/Smug's_Underground_Wiki> initially known as “Smug's Underground“</a> ). </p>
      <p style="font-size:16px">The Kaomojian-Korewan Civil War</p>
      <p style="font-size:10px">Throughout the early days of the established bridge between the kaomojians & the korewans, a sudden outburst by the kaomojians took place that triggered & led to a short-lived civil war between both parties, ultimately lasted about twenty minutes & resulted in an awkward capitulation of kaomojians. No injuries took place, however, the Faggot Dome has neutralized almost all kaomojian rocket missiles aimed towards #general where innocent korewan residents were almost striked.</p>
